A web browser extension (and a fork of Decentraleyes) that emulates Content Delivery Networks to improve your online privacy. It intercepts traffic, finds supported resources locally, and injects them into the environment. All of this happens automatically, so no prior configuration is required. Feel free to use the following [testing utility](https://www.localcdn.org/test/) to find out if you are properly protected. For more information, please read the [tutorial](https://www.localcdn.org/tutorial) or the [Wiki](https://codeberg.org/nobody/LocalCDN/wiki). You can also [download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/localcdn-fork-of-decentraleyes/) the extension directly from Mozilla and just try it.

> **Note:** LocalCDN is no silver bullet, but it does prevent a lot of websites from making you send these kinds of requests. Ultimately, you can make LocalCDN block requests for any missing CDN resources, too.

#### How does it work?
LocalCDN uses redirection for certain requests. There is a [mapping file](https://codeberg.org/nobody/LocalCDN/src/branch/main/core/mappings.js#L71) that lists the source (all CDNs and the path to the frameworks) and a [resource file](https://codeberg.org/nobody/LocalCDN/src/branch/main/core/resources.js#L328) that defines the destination.

Currently only JavaScript and CSS files are redirected. However, some CSS files internally refer to other files, e.g. Font Awesome. All requests are redirected to a local file, e.g. [jQuery](https://codeberg.org/nobody/LocalCDN/src/branch/main/resources/jquery). This is the reason why the extension is currently 10 MB in size. Only if LocalCDN cannot find a local resource (and the option is enabled), a request will be blocked.

An adblocker (e.g. uBlock Origin, uMatrix or AdGuard) decides which requests are allowed. Only if your adblocker allows a request, it will be intercepted by LocalCDN. LocalCDN catches the request after an adblocker and not before.

## What's the different of LocalCDN in comparison to other CDN emulators?

## We need you!

![We Need You!](pages/images/we-need-you.png?raw=true "We Need You!")

The whole Internet is full of different frameworks and CDNs that negatively affect your privacy. If you find a website that embeds another unsupported version of a framework, please report that website.

#### :warning: **Important** :warning:

In some cases, it isn't possible to use our framework because the website sets up a strong "Same Origin Policy" (SOP). Please read [Broken JavaScript or CSS on some websites](https://codeberg.org/nobody/LocalCDN/wiki/Home#user-content-7-a-website-looks-weird-or-cannot-be-used-if-i-deactivate-localcdn-everything-works-what-is-the-problem) before opening an issue.

On behalf of everyone: Thank you!
